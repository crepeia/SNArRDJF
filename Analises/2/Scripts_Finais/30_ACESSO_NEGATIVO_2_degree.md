SNA Descritive Analysis from "Projeto Redes de Atenção às pessoas que consomem álcool e outras Drogas em Juiz de Fora-MG   Brazil"  - SNArRDJF

Here you can find a basic script to analysis data from SNArRDJF - this script was elaborated considering its use for orther matrix adjacency data from SNArRDJF - Here we are going to analyse:

# 30_ACESSO_NEGATIVO

`#########################
`# Basic Preparation #####
`#########################

#Loading objects generated with previous script 

```r
rm(list = ls()) # removing previous objects to be sure that we don't have objects conflicts name
load("~/SNArRDJF/Robject/acesso_negativo_data.RData")
```
##Reload packages

```r
suppressMessages(library(RColorBrewer))
#suppressMessages(library(car))
#suppressMessages(library(xtable))
suppressMessages(library(igraph))
#suppressMessages(library(miniCRAN))
#suppressMessages(library(magrittr))
#suppressMessages(library(keyplayer))
#suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
#suppressMessages(library(feather))
#suppressMessages(library(visNetwork))
#suppressMessages(library(knitr))
suppressMessages(library(DT))
```
##Adding phantom tools

```r
#In order to get dinamic javascript object install those ones. If you get problems installing go to Stackoverflow.com and type your error to discover what to do. In some cases the libraries need to be intalled in outside R libs.
#devtools::install_github("wch/webshot")
#webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
##Setting a random seed - this is a good strategy to keep the same graph pattern layout in a new report generation

```r
set.seed(123)
```


##Simplify Graph - removing loops and duble edges 

```r
#acesso_negativo<-simplify(acesso_negativo) #Simplify
```


#Centrality Measures

• For undirected graphs:

– Actor centrality - involvement (connections) with other actors

• For directed graphs:

– Actor centrality - source of the ties (outgoing edges)

– Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)

In general - high centrality degree means direct contact with many other actors

##Centrality Degree (number of ties/nearest neighbors).

##Saving in igrpah object

```r
V(acesso_negativo)$indegree<-degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "in") # Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)
V(acesso_negativo)$outdegree <- degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "out") # Actor centrality - source of the ties (outgoing edges)
V(acesso_negativo)$totaldegree <- degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "total")
```
##Saving in Global Environment as an object

```r
acesso_negativo_indegree<-degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "in")
acesso_negativo_outdegree<-degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "out")
acesso_negativo_totaldegree<-degree(acesso_negativo, mode = "total")

#Compute strength - weighted

A slightly more nuanced metric is “strength centrality”, which is defined as the sum of the weights of all the connections for a given node. This is also sometimes called “weighted degree centrality”

```r
V(acesso_negativo)$acesso_negativo_strength<- strength(acesso_negativo, weights=E(acesso_negativo)$weight)
acesso_negativo_strength<- strength(acesso_negativo, weights=E(acesso_negativo)$weight)

#Average Neighbor Degree versus Vertex Degree (log-log scale for 30_ACESSO_NEGATIVO)

The neighborhood of a given order y of a vertex v includes all vertices which are closer to v than the order. Ie. order y=0 is always v itself, order 1 is v plus its immediate neighbors, order 2 is order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.

##Merging mean and standart deviation

```r
total_table <- merge(aggdata_mean,aggdata_sd,by="Group")

#Rounding
Group<-total_table[,c(1)] #Keeping group
total_table<-total_table[,-c(1)] %>% round(2) #Rouding
total_table<-cbind(Group,total_table) #Binding toghter

#Organizing Variabels
total_table<-total_table[c("Group","In Degree(M)","In Degree(SD)", "Out Degree(M)", "Out Degree(SD)","Total Degree(M)", "Total Degree(SD)", "In Degree Normalized(M)", "In Degree Normalized(SD)", "Out Degree Normalized(M)", "Out Degree Normalized(SD)", "Total Degree Normalized(M)", "Total Degree Normalized(SD)", "Strength(M)","Strength(SD)", "Centralization Degree(M)","Centralization Degree(SD)","Average Neighbor Degree(M)","Average Neighbor Degree(SD)","Average Weighted Neighbor Degree(M)", "Average Weighted Neighbor Degree(SD)")]
```

##Plotting final table with round

```r
datatable(total_table, filter = 'top')
```

##Merging mean and standart deviation

```r
total_table <- merge(aggdata_mean,aggdata_sd,by="Group")

#Rounding
Group<-total_table[,c(1)] #Keeping group
total_table<-total_table[,-c(1)] %>% round(2) #Rouding
total_table<-cbind(Group,total_table) #Binding toghter

#Organizing Variabels
total_table<-total_table[c("Group","In Degree(M)","In Degree(SD)", "Out Degree(M)", "Out Degree(SD)","Total Degree(M)", "Total Degree(SD)", "In Degree Normalized(M)", "In Degree Normalized(SD)", "Out Degree Normalized(M)", "Out Degree Normalized(SD)", "Total Degree Normalized(M)", "Total Degree Normalized(SD)", "Strength(M)","Strength(SD)", "Centralization Degree(M)","Centralization Degree(SD)","Average Neighbor Degree(M)","Average Neighbor Degree(SD)","Average Weighted Neighbor Degree(M)", "Average Weighted Neighbor Degree(SD)")]
```

##Plotting final table with round

```r
datatable(total_table, filter = 'top')
```

#Organizing Variabels
