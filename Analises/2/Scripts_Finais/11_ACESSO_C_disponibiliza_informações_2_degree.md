SNA Descritive Analysis from "Projeto Redes de Atenção às pessoas que consomem álcool e outras Drogas em Juiz de Fora-MG   Brazil"  - SNArRDJF

Here you can find a basic script to analysis data from SNArRDJF - this script was elaborated considering its use for orther matrix adjacency data from SNArRDJF - Here we are going to analyse:

# 11_ACESSO C) Este serviço disponibiliza informações sobre suas ativades para o seu serviço. (var9)

`#########################
`# Basic Preparation #####
`#########################

#Loading objects generated with previous script 

```r
rm(list = ls()) # removing previous objects to be sure that we don't have objects conflicts name
load("~/SNArRDJF/Robject/var9_data.RData")
```
##Reload packages

```r
suppressMessages(library(RColorBrewer))
#suppressMessages(library(car))
#suppressMessages(library(xtable))
suppressMessages(library(igraph))
#suppressMessages(library(miniCRAN))
#suppressMessages(library(magrittr))
#suppressMessages(library(keyplayer))
#suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
#suppressMessages(library(feather))
#suppressMessages(library(visNetwork))
#suppressMessages(library(knitr))
suppressMessages(library(DT))
```
##Adding phantom tools

```r
#In order to get dinamic javascript object install those ones. If you get problems installing go to Stackoverflow.com and type your error to discover what to do. In some cases the libraries need to be intalled in outside R libs.
#devtools::install_github("wch/webshot")
#webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
##Setting a random seed - this is a good strategy to keep the same graph pattern layout in a new report generation

```r
set.seed(123)
```


##Simplify Graph - removing loops and duble edges 

```r
#var9<-simplify(var9) #Simplify
```


#Centrality Measures

• For undirected graphs:

– Actor centrality - involvement (connections) with other actors

• For directed graphs:

– Actor centrality - source of the ties (outgoing edges)

– Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)

In general - high centrality degree means direct contact with many other actors

##Centrality Degree (number of ties/nearest neighbors).

##Saving in igrpah object

```r
V(var9)$indegree<-degree(var9, mode = "in") # Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)
V(var9)$outdegree <- degree(var9, mode = "out") # Actor centrality - source of the ties (outgoing edges)
V(var9)$totaldegree <- degree(var9, mode = "total")
```
##Saving in Global Environment as an object

```r
var9_indegree<-degree(var9, mode = "in")
var9_outdegree<-degree(var9, mode = "out")
var9_totaldegree<-degree(var9, mode = "total")
```

#Compute strength - weighted

A slightly more nuanced metric is “strength centrality”, which is defined as the sum of the weights of all the connections for a given node. This is also sometimes called “weighted degree centrality”

```r

#Average Neighbor Degree versus Vertex Degree (log-log scale for 11_ACESSO C) Este serviço disponibiliza informações sobre suas ativades para o seu serviço. (var9))

The neighborhood of a given order y of a vertex v includes all vertices which are closer to v than the order. Ie. order y=0 is always v itself, order 1 is v plus its immediate neighbors, order 2 is order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.

#Adding type

#Adding names
