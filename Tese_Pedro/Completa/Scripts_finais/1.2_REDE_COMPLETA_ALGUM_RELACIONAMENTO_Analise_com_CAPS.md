##Adding phantom tools

```r
#In order to get dinamic javascript object install those ones. If you get problems installing go to Stackoverflow.com and type your error to discover what to do. In some cases the libraries need to be intalled in outside R libs.
#devtools::install_github("wch/webshot")
#webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
##Setting a random seed - this is a good strategy to keep the same graph pattern layout in a new report generation

```r
set.seed(123)
```




#Removing CAPS AD - not here

```r
#x2_without_CAPS<-delete_vertices(x2,V(x2)[V2_LABEL_ID=="q170_CAPS...CAPS.AD"])
x2_with_CAPS<-x2
```

##Vertices and Edges Number

```r
#1. Vertices and Edges
x2_with_CAPS_vcount<-vcount(x2_with_CAPS)
x2_with_CAPS_ecount<-ecount(x2_with_CAPS)
```
##Vertice Number
Each vertice represents a service - named as an actor in our network

```r
vcount(x2_with_CAPS)
```

```
## [1] 187
```
##Edge Number
Each edge represents a connection between two services named as a tie

```r
ecount(x2_with_CAPS)
```

```
## [1] 1558
```

#Density - The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
The density of a binary network is simply the proportion of all possible ties that are actually present.

For a valued network, density is defined as the sum of the ties divided by the number of possible ties (i.e. the ratio of all tie strength that is actually present to the number of possible ties).  

The density of a network may give us insights into such phenomena as the speed at which information diffuses among the nodes, and the extent to which actors have high levels of social capital and/or social constraint.


##Edge Density
The density of a graph is the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges.

```r
edge_density_x2_with_CAPS<-edge_density(x2_with_CAPS) #The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
edge_density_x2_with_CAPS
```

```
## [1] 0.04479328
```
##Edge connectivity - Adhesion
The edge connectivity of a graph or two vertices, this is recently also called group adhesion.

```r
edge_connectivity(x2_with_CAPS, source =NULL, target =NULL, checks = T) #source and target can be replaced - their are here just as default
```

```
## [1] 0
```
###Adhesion example
In order to use this we need to call source and target using the number of each vertex instead of the name - type in R to get numbers


```r
#Names and numbers

# list all if you have no idea about services id
# V(x2_with_CAPS)$name 

# list all three first (you can use c(1:3))
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[1]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "ASS_HOS_ Hospital de Pronto Socorro – HPS"
```

```r
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[2]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "AMB_SAM_ Centro de Atenção à Saúde Mental (CASM)"
```

```r
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[3]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "CAPS_AD"
```

```r
# list by others id's
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[6]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "CRE_SOC_ CREAS Norte"
```

```r
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[150]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "UAP_RUR_ Buiéié"
```

```r
V(x2_with_CAPS)$name[185]  # just as an example
```

```
## [1] "AJU_MUT_ Grupo A.A. Liberdade"
```
##Edge Connectivity - "CAPS_AD"==3 and "UAPS RURAL Buiéié"==150
Point connection calculates the number of nodes that would have to be removed in order for one actor to no longer be able to reach another.  If there are many different pathways that connect two actors, they have high "connectivity" in the sense that there are multiple ways for a signal to reach from one to the other - lower number - worse resilience 


```r
edge_connectivity(x2_with_CAPS, source =150, target =3, checks = T) 
```

```
## [1] 1
```

#Vertex Connectivity - Group Cohesion

It is the minimum number of vertices needed to remove to make the graph not strongly connected. (If the graph is not strongly connected then this is zero.). The cohesion of a graph (as defined by White and Harary, see references), is the vertex connectivity of the graph. This is calculated by cohesion.

These three functions essentially calculate the same measure(s), more precisely vertex_connectivity is the most general, the other two are included only for the ease of using more descriptive function names.


```r
vertex_connectivity(x2_with_CAPS, source = NULL, target = NULL, checks = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 0
```

##Cohesion example

In order to use this we need to call source and target using the number of each vertex instead of the name - type in R to get numbers - see example above for more details 

##Vertex Connectivity - "CRE_SOC_ CREAS Norte"==6 and "AJU_MUT_ Grupo A.A. Liberdade" ==185
Minimum number of vertices needed to remove to make the vertex not connected by any vertex - it leads an error in case of using two connected vertex 

```r
vertex_connectivity(x2_with_CAPS, source =6, target =185, checks = T) 
```

```

#Centrality Measures

• For undirected graphs:

– Actor centrality - involvement (connections) with other actors

• For directed graphs:

– Actor centrality - source of the ties (outgoing edges)

– Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)

In general - high centrality degree means direct contact with many other actors

##Centrality Degree (number of ties/nearest neighbors).

##Saving in igrpah object

```r
V(x2_with_CAPS)$x2_indegree<-degree(x2_with_CAPS, mode = "in") # Actor prestige - recipient of many ties (incoming edges)

#Average Neighbor Degree versus Vertex Degree (log-log scale for 1.2 - ALGUM RELACIONAMENTO (x2))

The neighborhood of a given order y of a vertex v includes all vertices which are closer to v than the order. Ie. order y=0 is always v itself, order 1 is v plus its immediate neighbors, order 2 is order 1 plus the immediate neighbors of the vertices in order 1, etc.

#Closeness - centrality based on distance to others in the graph 

*How close an actor to all the other actors in network?*

High closeness centrality - short communication path to others, minimal number of steps to reach others.

Answers the “Kevin Bacon” question:

*How many steps are required to access every other vertex from a given vertex?*

One practical implication of this metric: it helps you gauge how information might spread within your network, and who might be the best people to leverage if you need to make sure information gets around. Link here: <http://www.tc.umn.edu/~alink/R-social-network-analysis.html>

Closeness centrality can be defined as a measure of how far other nodes are from the node in question. Nodes with high closeness centrality are likely to be relatively efficient in receiving or transmitting information to/from distant parts of the social network.

Scores may be interpreted as arising from a reciprocal process in which the centrality of each actor is proportional to the sum of the centralities of those actors to whom he or she is connected. 

In general, vertices with high eigenvector centralities are those which are connected to many other vertices which are, in turn, connected to many others (and so on). (The perceptive may realize that this implies that the largest values will be obtained by individuals in large cliques (or high-density substructures)

#Betweenness - Number of shortest paths going through the actor σst(i)

High betweenness centrality - vertex lies on many shortest paths. Probability that a communication from s
to t will go through i - considering σst(i).

Betweenness measures the number of shortest paths between nodes in the network that go through the node in question. Nodes with relatively high betweenness are likely to be key conduits of information flow across a network, and their removal may have a large impact on spreading phenomena.

##Betweenness Centrality -(Vertex)

Betweenness centrality based on a broker position connecting others or Number of geodesics that pass through the node or the edge. A higher number means an more important node.

Dyads are 2-subgraphs where a subgraph is a subset of actors taken from the complete set of network actors and all links
between them. See more here <http://file.scirp.org/pdf/SN_2013012915270187.pdf>

#Triad Census - Check this out in order to understand triad lables

The studies about transitivity in social networks led Holland and Leinhardt (1975) to propose that the local structure in social networks can be expressed by the triad census or triad count, the numbers of triads of any kinds.

##Triad Census Types 
The following labels gives the 16 different triads for directed graphs. The coding refers to the numbers of mutual, asymmetric, and null dyads, with a further identifying letter: Up, Down, Cyclical, Transitive.

E.g., 1-2-0-D has *1* mutual, *2* asymmetric, *0* null dyads, and the *Down* orientation.

#Distances and paths

Defined as the shortest distance between each pair of nodes in the network (in both directions for directed graphs).

##Average path length between any two given nodes

Calculates the average path length in a graph, by calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices (both ways for directed graphs). 

This function does not consider edge weights currently and uses a breadth-first search.

##Simplify Graph - removing loops and duble edges 

```r
#x2_with_CAPS_u<-simplify(x2_with_CAPS) #Simplify

x2_with_CAPS_u<-as.undirected(x2_with_CAPS, mode="collapse",edge.attr.comb=list(weight="mean","ignore"))
```

#Find cliques (complete subgraphs of an undirected graph)
Graph clique is a subset of vertices of a graph such that every two vertices in the clique are adjacent. - ***To check****

##Number of cliques - subgraphs

```r
cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u<-cliques(x2_with_CAPS_u) # list of cliques 
length(cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u)
```

```
## [1] 37973
```
##Number of cliques by cliques size

```r
cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u_size<-sapply(cliques(x2_with_CAPS_u), length) 
cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u_size_t<-table(cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u_size)
cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u_size_t
```

```
## cliques_x2_with_CAPS_u_size
##    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11 
##  187 1231 3400 6325 8602 8493 5912 2798  857  155   13

##Size of largest clique 
A maximum clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex (not included in larger one). 

```r
clique_num(x2_with_CAPS_u)
```

```
## [1] 11
```
##Number of maximal cliques

```r
count_max_cliques(x2_with_CAPS_u)
```

```
## [1] 652
```
##Finding of largest cliques

```r
largest_cliques<-largest_cliques(x2_with_CAPS_u) # cliques with max number of nodes
length(largest_cliques)
```

```
## [1] 13
```

##Plotting the largest cliques - important to consider connectivite 

```r
#Coloring largest clique as gold and others one as gray
vcol <- rep("grey80", vcount(x2_with_CAPS_u))
vcol[unlist(largest_cliques(x2_with_CAPS_u))] <- "gold"

#Saving gray and gold as igraph attribute
